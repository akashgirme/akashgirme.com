**MeetWave** is an Omegle-inspired video chat platform developed using TypeScript and React. It leverages WebRTC technology to facilitate peer-to-peer communication, enabling users to engage in random video conversations without intermediary servers. MeetWave is designed to provide seamless, real-time video interactions while maintaining user privacy through direct connections. The application uses a signaling server for initial peer discovery, making it suitable for modern, low-latency communication use cases.
This introduction highlights the key aspects of your application:

- It's an Omegle-like platform (random video chat)
- It uses TypeScript and React for development
- It employs WebRTC for peer-to-peer communication
- It emphasizes privacy and real-time interaction
- It uses a signaling server for peer discovery

## Technologies Used

- **TypeScript**: Provides type safety and enhances code maintainability.
- **Node.js**: Ensures optimal performance and scalability for handling concurrent connections and data operations.
- **WebRTC**: WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) is a technology that enables real-time communication between web browsers and other devices. It allows for voice and video calls, file sharing, and screen sharing without the need for plugins or other software.
