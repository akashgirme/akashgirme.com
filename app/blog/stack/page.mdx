## 1. Framework (Nest.js & Next.js)

**Nest.js**\
In my last company I worked with [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/) and I absolutely loved it. It makes node.js development so much easier.
Nest.js is designed for building efficient and scalable server-side applications using Node.js.
Its opinionated architecture makes it simple to manage a large codebase at scale.

Some out-of-box features of nest.js
- Modular Architecture
- TypeScript Support
- Dependency Injection

**Next.js**\
For frontend development, Next.js is an absolute beast of a framework.
With server-side rendering, I can create a lightweight backend within Next.js itself. 
Additionally, the support for Next.js on Vercel is excellent, as I primarily use Vercel for my deployments.

## 2. Languages (TypeScript & Golang)

**TypeScript**\
TypeScript is my default language for both Nest.js and Next.js. Although there is more to write in TypeScript than in JavaScript, the type safety it provides makes it worth using TypeScript.

**Golang**\
Golang is my favorite language due to its simplicity and speed.

- [chi](https://go-chi.io/#/) as router for building Go http services. Chi is simple and straightforward, adhering closely to Go's standard library idioms.
- [sqlc](https://sqlc.dev/) for compiling sql to type-safe code, Since I don't use ORMs in golang.
- Structuring project in golang is very much confusing. I usually follow this [guidelines](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout).


## 3. Database (Postgres)

Postgres is my go-to database. When buidling project with Nest.js I used [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/) as ORM and when in Golang I used [sqlc](https://sqlc.dev/).

## 4. AI (Perplexity & Claude)

Perplexity and Cluade are my go-to AI tools.\
Claude's code generation is excellent and Perplexity is very good in AI-Powered search.
